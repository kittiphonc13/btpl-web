# Performance Testing Plan for BPL Web

## Performance Metrics to Measure

### 1. Page Load Times
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

### 2. Runtime Performance
- JavaScript execution time
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Frame rate (FPS) during animations/transitions

### 3. Network Performance
- Number of requests
- Request sizes
- Response times
- Cache effectiveness

## Testing Tools
- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)
- WebPageTest
- Chrome DevTools Performance panel
- Next.js Analytics (if enabled)
- React DevTools Profiler

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Initial Load Performance
- [ ] Cold load (first visit, no cache)
- [ ] Warm load (return visit, with cache)
- [ ] Mobile network simulation (3G, 4G)

### 2. Authentication Performance
- [ ] Login process timing
- [ ] Registration process timing
- [ ] Token refresh performance

### 3. Data Operations
- [ ] Profile data loading and rendering
- [ ] Blood pressure log data loading and rendering
- [ ] Adding new blood pressure entries
- [ ] Exporting data to Excel
- [ ] Medication list loading and operations

### 4. UI Interactions
- [ ] Navigation transitions
- [ ] Form interactions
- [ ] Modal dialogs
- [ ] Dropdown menus
- [ ] Date picker interactions

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Already Implemented
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Suppressed hydration warnings
- CSP optimization for API connections

### Potential Optimizations
- Image optimization
- Component lazy loading
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Service worker for offline capabilities
- Preloading critical resources

## Benchmarking Process
1. Establish baseline performance metrics
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations
4. Re-measure to verify improvements
5. Document findings and recommendations

## Performance Targets
- LCP: < 2.5s (Good), < 4s (Needs Improvement), > 4s (Poor)
- FID: < 100ms (Good), < 300ms (Needs Improvement), > 300ms (Poor)
- CLS: < 0.1 (Good), < 0.25 (Needs Improvement), > 0.25 (Poor)
- TTFB: < 800ms
- Overall page load: < 3s on broadband, < 5s on 4G mobile
